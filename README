TODO
- make movement update faster but with smaller changes to make it look more natural
- add active decision making (remove randomness, or maybe as a command-line option)
- make all the game settings command-line options
- brainstorm ways to make the game take longer but be more interesting still (I don't want long-winded stale mates with little action but ways to make it visually stimulating and interesting gameplay that lasts longer)
